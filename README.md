# KotlinApps

The first app is a complex numbers calculator.
It enables user to input the numbers, choose operation
and display the result on Gaussian plane.

The second app is a game. User decides about the
movement of a ball by moving the phone.
The program uses OpenGL and embedded accelerometer.

The third app is a funny simulator of a wish list for Santa Claus.
User says presents he wants to get, makes himself a photo and
merges everything in a postcard with his localisation added.
The program uses Google Assistant, camera, localisation and WebView.

All three of these apps were made for Mobile Technologies course
